The operating earnings for 2023 were $37,350 million, compared to $30,853 million in 2022. The outlook for 2023 suggested that most non-insurance businesses would face lower earnings, but this decline would be cushioned by decent results at BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE). However, the expectations for both BNSF and BHE were not met. Insurance performed as expected. Another key point discussed is the difference between \"net earnings (loss)\" and \"operating earnings\". The net earnings figures for 2021, 2022, and 2023 were $90 billion, ($23 billion), and $96 billion, respectively. However, Berkshire prefers to report \"operating earnings\", which exclude unrealized capital gains or losses.

      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Berkshire's insurance business has seen a significant increase in earnings, led by the performance of GEICO. In 2024, the insurance business delivered a major increase in earnings, with GEICO being a long-held gem that underwent major repolishing. In terms of underwriting profits, over the past two decades, Berkshire's insurance business has generated $32 billion of after-tax profits from underwriting, about 3.3 cents per dollar of sales after income tax. The float has grown from $46 billion to $171 billion during this period. In 2023, the insurance-underwriting profit was $5,428 million, a significant improvement from a loss of $30 million in 2022. For investment income, Berkshire saw a rise from $6,484 million in 2022 to $9,567 million in 2023.\n",

He played a significant role in shaping the company's direction, advising Warren Buffett to focus on buying wonderful businesses at fair prices instead of fair businesses at wonderful prices.
